## There are 5 types of storages in S3

In Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service), there are different storage classes or types, each designed for specific needs based on cost, availability, and durability. Here are some simplified explanations:

### 1. Standard :
 This is the default storage class. It's like keeping things in your room where they're easily accessible. It offers high availability, low latency, and durability, but it's slightly more expensive.

### 2. Infrequent Access (IA):
 Similar to storing things in a garage or attic that you don't need very often. It's a cheaper option than standard storage, but accessing the data may cost a little more and take slightly longer.

### 4. One Zone-IA :
 Like storing items in a nearby storage unit instead of a more secure place. It's cost-effective but stores data in a single availability zone, making it less resilient to outages compared to other classes.

### 5. Intelligent-Tiering :
 It's like having a smart storage system that automatically moves your data between frequent and infrequent access tiers. It's cost-effective as it optimizes storage costs based on usage patterns.

Glacier and Glacier Deep Archive: These are like long-term storage solutions where you store items in a storage unit far away, only accessing them very rarely. They're the cheapest options but take longer to retrieve data.
